Display a side tab that you can easily link to any page. Customize the tab text, font and colors. It's that simple. That's Simple Side Tab.

== Description ==

Add a "Global Call To Action" on your website. Simple Side Tab adds a vertical tab to the left or right side of the browser window that links to any page. The tab stays in place as your visitor scrolls down the page so it's always visible and ready for action. Works great on Mobile too.

Need an effective way to highlight a conversion page? This plugin will help.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are graphics used to display the tab?  =

No. The tab is built with CSS. That way, you can customize the tab text, fonts and colors very easily.

= Can I get the tab to work on the right side of the browser? =

Yes. Now it works on both sides.

= Can you setup multiple tabs with this plugin? =

No. We want to keep it simple so we are only supporting one tab. More than one tab would complicate this plugin quite a bit. Besides, two tabs doesn't look that great on mobile. If you need more than one tab, this plugin is not for you.

= How can I conditionally change the tab text or the URL? =

You can use the `rum_sst_plugin_text_for_tab` filter to modify the output of the tab. Here are some examples:

Add a Font Awesome Icon to the front of the tab text (assuming Font Awesome is supported with your theme)
<pre><code>// filter the tab output from the Simple Side Tab plugin
function rum_filter_simple_side_tab_text( $text ) {

	$text = &#039;&lt;i class="fa fa-life-ring"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &#039; . $text;

	return $text;
}
add_filter( &#039;rum_sst_plugin_text_for_tab&#039;, &#039;rum_filter_simple_side_tab_text&#039;, 10 , 1 ); </code></pre>

Contidionally turn off the tab on the homepage
<pre><code>// filter the tab display value to conditionally turn off the tab
function rum_filter_simple_side_tab_display( $display ) {

	if ( is_front_page() ) {

		$display = false;
	}

	return $display;
}
add_filter( &#039;rum_sst_plugin_display_tab&#039;, &#039;rum_filter_simple_side_tab_display&#039;, 10 , 1 );</code></pre>
